          <h2>FENNEC FOX</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            The fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small crepuscular fox native to
            the Sahara Desert and the Sinai Peninsula. Its most distinctive
            feature is its unusually large ears, which serve to dissipate
            heat. The fennec is the smallest canid species. Its coat, ears,
            and kidney functions have adapted to the desert environment with
            high temperatures and little water. Also, its hearing is sensitive
            to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small
            mammals, and birds. The fennec has a life span of up to 14 years
            in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators
            are the Verreaux's eagle-owl, jackals, and other large mammals.
            Fennec families dig out burrows in the sand for habitation and
            protection, which can be as large as 120 m2 (1,292 sq ft) and
            adjoin the burrows of other families. Precise population figures
            are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings;
            these indicate that the fennec is currently not threatened by
            extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to
            information gathered from captive animals. The fennec is usually
            assigned to the genus Vulpes; however, this is debated due to
            differences between the fennec and other fox species. The fennec's
            fur is prized by indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some
            parts of the world, it is considered an exotic pet.

          <h2>LLAMA</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="assets/images/llama.jpg" />
          <br />
          <p>
            The llama (/ˈlɑːmə/; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama]) (Lama glama)
            is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat
            and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.
          </p>
          <p>
            Llamas are very social animals and live with others as a herd.
            Their wool is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas can learn simple
            tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry
            about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles).
            The name llama (in the past also spelled "lama" or "glama") was
            adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.
          </p>
          The ancestors of Llamas are thought to have originated from the
          central plains of North America about 40 million years ago, and
          subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago
          during the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice
          age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North
          America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and
          alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America
          in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and
          100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada.
          <p>
            In Aymara mythology llamas are important beings. The Heavenly
            Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it
            rains. According to Aymara eschatology llamas will return to the
            water springs and lagoons where they come from at the end of time.

          <h2>MANED WOLF</h2>
          <br />
          <img src="assets/images/maned-wolf.jpg" />
          <br />
          <p>
            The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is the largest canine of
            South America. Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it is
            neither a fox nor a wolf. It is the only species in the genus
            Chrysocyon (meaning "golden dog").
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the largest canid in South America, with a weight between 20
            and 30 kg, and reaches up to 90 cm at the withers. Its long, thin
            legs and dense reddish coat give it an unmistakable appearance.
            The maned wolf is a crepuscular and omnivorous animal adapted to
            the open environments of the South American savanna, with an
            important role in the seed dispersal of fruits, especially the
            wolf apple (Solanum lycocarpum). The maned wolf is a solitary
            animal. It communicates primarily by scent marking, but also gives
            a loud call known as "roar-barking".
          </p>
          <p>
            This mammal is found in open and semi open habitats, especially
            grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the Cerrado of
            south, central-west, and southeastern Brazil; Paraguay; northern
            Argentina; and Bolivia east and north of the Andes, and far
            southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only). It is very rare in
            Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely through loss of
            habitat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists
            it as near threatened, while it is considered a vulnerable species
            by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural
            Resources. Pangolin Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters,
            are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς,
            "horny scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera:
            Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species
            found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species
            each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size
            from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin
            species are also known.

          <br />

          <p>
            Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the
            order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς, "horny scale"). The one
            extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and
            Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species found in Asia, while
            Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in
            Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm
            (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also
            known.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their
            skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. They live
            in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins
            are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and
            termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend
            to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter
            of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales,
            which are used in Chinese traditional medicine) and heavy
            deforestation of their natural habitats and are the most
            trafficked mammals in the world. As of January 2020, there are
            eight species of pangolin whose conservation status is listed in
            the threatened tier. Three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and
            M. javanica) are critically endangered, three (Phataginus
            tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are
            endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia
            temminckii) are vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species
            of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

          <p>
            The pygmy marmoset, genus Cebuella, is a small genus of New World
            monkey native to rainforests of the western Amazon Basin in South
            America. It is notable for being the smallest monkey and one of
            the smallest primates in the world, at just over 100 grams (3.5
            oz). It is generally found in evergreen and river-edge forests and
            is a gum-feeding specialist, or a gummivore.
          </p>
          <p>
            About 83% of the pygmy marmoset population lives in stable troops
            of two to nine individuals, including a dominant male, a breeding
            female, and up to four successive litters of offspring. The modal
            size of a standard stable troop would be six individuals. Although
            most groups consist of family members, some may also include one
            or two additional adult members. Members of the group communicate
            using a complex system including vocal, chemical, and visual
            signals. Three main calling signals depend on the distance the
            call needs to travel. These monkeys may also make visual displays
            when threatened or to show dominance. Chemical signaling using
            secretions from glands on the chest and genital area allow the
            female to indicate to the male when she is able to reproduce. The
            female gives birth to twins twice a year and the parental care is
            shared between the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pygmy marmoset has been viewed as somewhat different from
            typical marmosets, most of which are classified in the genera
            Callithrix and Mico, and thus is accorded its own genus, Cebuella,
            within the family Callitrichidae. The biggest threats are habitat
            loss and the pet trade.

          <h2>RED PANDA</h2>
          <br />

          <br />
          <p>
            The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a mammal species native to the
            eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It is listed as
            Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is
            estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to
            decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and
            inbreeding depression. Despite its name, it is not closely related
            to the giant panda.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a
            waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the
            size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body, and is somewhat
            heavier. It is arboreal and feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats
            eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active
            from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day. It is
            also called the lesser panda, the red bearcat, and the red
            cat-bear.
          </p>
          <p>
            The red panda is the only living member of the genus Ailurus and
            the family Ailuridae. It has previously been placed in the raccoon
            and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis
            provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own
            family, Ailuridae, which is part of the superfamily Musteloidea,
            along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families. Traditionally
            it was thought to consist of two subspecies. However, results of
            genetic analysis indicate that there are probably two distinct red
